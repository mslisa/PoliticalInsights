## Questions and Issues (MoSCoW)

### Overall
* C - LM Low Priority d3 reaction? - Can we make graph points "jump" to new position?
* S - SM Dynamic text below effectiveness, contributions - Can we add data tables below graphs with the selected rep's numbers?

### Top of page
* C - SM - Make address bar constant so you can switch addresses.

### Bipartisan
* C - SM Bottom of to-do list - The lack of hover for this graph was interpreted as something was broken.

## Twitter
* C - LB converting data to correct format and sending code to Scott
* S - LB write up - Explanation on the methodology page.

## Potential updates for future
* Update ranking on effectiveness so large numbers are in anticipated area. Right now rank 1 being furthes from axis crossing is unintuitive.
* Edit wording to be more efficient and streamlined.
* Have dynamic comments per graph. Examples:
  * Finance comment that no data is found for person only when perosn has no data.
  * The house of representative view of effectiveness has a naturally occuring vertical bar. Describe why this is happening when it appears.
